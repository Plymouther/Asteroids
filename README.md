# OOP Learning Project

This project was created as a way to learn and practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. The focus is on designing a **modular** and **scalable system** using core OOP principles like classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## Features

- **Encapsulation:** Organizing code into well-structured classes.
- **Inheritance:** Utilizing class hierarchies to avoid redundancy.
- **Polymorphism:** Implementing flexible and reusable methods.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding implementation details for cleaner code.
- **Modular Design:** Ensuring code reusability and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language
